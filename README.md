# UserManagerReact
 
This was my first attempt with node.js and react.  The numerous modules were very intriguing and I used this to teach myself typescript language.  I then compiled it to javascript using CLI.  Some of the formatting didn't work and I tried to run it with the typescript files as well but it just kept looking at the javascript files.  I created some custom ports for the server and app so it would run more efficiently.
